# Algorithms and Data Structures I - C Programming

This repository contains my codes, projects, and assignments from the AEDS I course in C Programming at the Federal University of Ouro Preto.

## Topics Covered

- Recursion: tail recursion, indirect recursion, nested recursion, excessive recursion, and backtracking.
- Basics of Algorithmic Complexity Analysis: Asymptotic analysis of functions, definitions and properties, analysis of the best case, worst case, and average case.
- Abstract Data Types: Abstraction and modeling of problems, definitions, and concepts of Abstract Data Types.
- Linear Data Structures: Lists, Queues, and Stacks.
- Hierarchical Data Structures: Binary Trees, Red-Black Trees, and Heaps.
- Algorithms and Techniques for Search and Sorting: Search methods (sequential search and binary search), types of sorting, classification by efficiency and stability, Bubble Sort, Selection Sort, Insertion Sort, Shell Sort, Quick Sort, Merge Sort, and Heap Sort.
